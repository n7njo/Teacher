## Understanding Variables

Think of a variable as a **labeled container** that stores information in your program.

### Real-World Analogy
Imagine you have a box labeled "favorite_color". You can:
- Put something in it: \`favorite_color = "blue"\`
- Look at what's inside: \`console.log(favorite_color)\`
- Change what's inside: \`favorite_color = "green"\`

### Why Variables Matter
Variables allow programs to:
1. Store data for later use
2. Make code more readable
3. Avoid repetition
4. Create dynamic, interactive applications
